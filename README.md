# Overview

Library App is a simple TypeScript application that simulates a virtual library.  
It allows users to add, list, search, and remove books directly in the terminal.  
The main purpose of this software is to practice and demonstrate key features of TypeScript such as classes, recursion, lists, asynchronous functions, and exception handling.  

Through this project, I aimed to strengthen my understanding of how TypeScript enhances JavaScript with type safety, object-oriented programming, and better tooling.

# Development Environment

- **Tools**: Visual Studio Code, Node.js, GitHub  
- **Language**: TypeScript  
- **Libraries/Modules**:  
  - `ts-node` (for running TypeScript directly in the terminal during development)  
  - `readline` (to handle user input asynchronously in the terminal)  
  - `jest` (for testing core functionality)

# Future Work

- Improve the CLI interface with more commands and better user experience  
- Expand search features (by year, partial title, or author)  
- Implement real persistence using a database or JSON file instead of simulating async saves  
- Add more comprehensive Jest tests and code coverage
